abstract = {Despite the significant progress in multiagent teamwork, existing research does not address the optimality of its prescriptions nor the complexity of the teamwork problem. Thus, we cannot determine whether the assumptions and approximations made by a particular theory gain enough efficiency to justify the losses in overall performance. To provide a tool for evaluating this tradeoff, we present a unified framework, the COMmunicative Multiagent Team Decision Problem (COM-MTDP) model, which is general enough to subsume many existing models of multiagent systems. We analyze use the COM-MTDP model to provide a breakdown of the computational complexity of constructing optimal teams under problem domains divided along the dimensions of observability and communication cost. We then exploit the COM-MTDP's ability to encode existing teamwork theories and models to encode two instantiations of joint intentions theory, including STEAM. We then derive a domain-independent criterion for optimal communication and provide a comparative analysis of the two joint intentions instantiations. We have implemented a reusable, domain-independent software package based COM-MTDPs to analyze teamwork coordination strategies, and we demonstrate its use by encoding and evaluating the two joint intentions strategies within an example domain.},

abstract = {A multiagent collaboration algorithm using the concepts of belief (B), desire (D) and intention (I) for the classical assignment problem is presented. The problem can be viewed as seeking a concurrent allocation of one different resource for every task. Existing sequential algorithms use a single agent to operate on all assignment values; each value indicates the application quality-of-service (A-QoS) of one resource for one task. However, for many network applications, it may be practically more effective or desirable to deploy multiple communicating agents to solve the problem. The proposed algorithm for collaborative assignment is motivated by this potential and the availability of multiagent technologies to implement it.Given an (N tasks and N resources) N \texttimes{} N assignment problem, the proposed algorithm has each different task represented by an agent possessing only (local) knowledge of A-QoS's of all resources for the task. The novelty of the algorithm lies in the generic BDI-based reasoning mechanism of task agents whose individual resource exchange intentions are arbitrated by a simple arbitration agent. The algorithm is examined both analytically and experimentally, and discussed, also in relation to existing multiagent work.},

abstract = {In multi-agent cooperation, agents share a common goal, which is evaluated through a global utility function. However, an agent typically cannot observe the global state of an uncertain environment, and therefore they must communicate with each other in order to share the information needed for deciding which actions to take. We argue that, when communication incurs a cost (due to resource consumption, for example), whether to communicate or not also becomes a decision to make. Hence, communication decision becomes part of the overall agent decision problem. In order to explicitly address this problem, we present a multi-agent extension to Markov decision processes in which communication can be modeled as an explicit action that incurs a cost. This framework provides a foundation for a quantified study of agent coordination policies and provides both motivation and insight to the design of heuristic approaches. An example problem is studied under this framework. From this example we can see the impact communication policies have on the overall agent policies, and what implications we can find toward the design of agent coordination policies.},
